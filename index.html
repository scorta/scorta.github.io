      <br>Softwear Engineer at <a href="https://coccoc.com/">Coc Coc</a></p>
      
      <p>I'm interested in programming, algorithm and some other computer-science things, because they are fun and challenging. I'm also enjoy thinking about other fields, like UI/UX, business, product, marketing; and sometime seeing myself doing that when working as an indie developer (making games and apps).</p>

      <p>Sometime I make video games as a hobby; and I write about them at <a href="https://www.alsatian.co/">my dev-log</a></p>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/scorta">My github</a>, where I store some small personal projects</p>

      <p>A fun & crazy project of mine about <a href="https://scorta.github.io/GuessPrivateKey/">guessing Bitcoin private key</a></p>

      <p>If you need to connect with me, here is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ducnd87/">my LinkedIn profile</a></p>
